Climate change and global warming are becoming increasingly relevant issues all over the world. California is no exception. This paper investigates how carbon dioxide emissions are affecting California’s climate. To narrow things down we are focusing our research on three distinct locations in California: Eureka, San Francisco, and San Diego. These locations were chosen because they are key to California's economy and represent the state's diverse climate regions and unique climate risks. We face problems with increasingly hot summers, heat waves, droughts, and wildfires.This study examines one of the main contributors to climate change: carbon dioxide emissions. The data will reveal how the change in emissions correlates to a rise in temperature and change in precipitation.

Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide can be found in the Earth’s atmosphere. They absorb and hold heat from the sun to keep our planet warm. However, as society continues to emit more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere holds more heat leading to increased temperatures, i.e. global warming. Carbon dioxide is especially problematic because 20–35% of it remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and some can persist for thousands of years, continuing to warm the planet long after it's emitted (Archer et al., 2009). Even if we cut emissions, the amount of carbon dioxide already in the air is only increasing.

Where is all this carbon dioxide coming from? One of the major sources of carbon emissions are the major fossil fuel companies that are responsible for a disproportionately large share of global industrial greenhouse gas. While some companies have taken steps to reduce emissions, research suggests they should also be held accountable for their historical contributions to climate change.
